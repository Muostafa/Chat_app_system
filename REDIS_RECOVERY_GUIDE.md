# Redis Recovery System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains the Redis crash recovery system implemented to prevent sequential number duplicates when Redis restarts.

## Problem Solved
**Before:** If Redis crashed, sequential counters would reset to the last snapshot (up to 60 seconds old), causing duplicate chat/message numbers and silent job failures.

**After:** Redis data persists on every write, and automatic recovery mechanisms detect and fix any inconsistencies.

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. Redis AOF Persistence (docker-compose.yml)
**Location:** `docker-compose.yml` line 23

```yaml
command: redis-server --appendonly yes --appendfsync everysec
```

**What it does:**
- Enables Append-Only File (AOF) persistence
- Writes every Redis command to disk
- Uses `everysec` fsync policy (balance between safety and performance)
- Ensures counter values survive Redis crashes

**Benefits:**
- Maximum 1 second of data loss (vs 60+ seconds with RDB snapshots)
- ~20% performance overhead (acceptable for production)
- Automatic on Redis restart

---

### 2. Recovery Job
**Location:** `app/jobs/rebuild_redis_counters_job.rb`

```ruby
RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_later
```

**What it does:**
- Queries database for max chat/message numbers
- Rebuilds all Redis counters from database state
- Logs all recovery actions
- Can be triggered manually or automatically

**Usage:**
```ruby
# Manual trigger via Rails console
RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_now

# Or queue for background processing
RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_later
```

**When to use:**
- After Redis data loss
- When health check shows inconsistencies
- After database restore/migration
- As part of disaster recovery

---

### 3. Startup Initializer
**Location:** `config/initializers/redis_recovery.rb`

**What it does:**
- Runs automatically on Rails startup (after 5 second delay)
- Samples ChatApplications and Chats to check consistency
- Compares Redis counters vs database max numbers
- Automatically triggers `RebuildRedisCountersJob` if inconsistency detected
- Only runs in development and production (skips test environment)

**How it works:**
1. Waits 5 seconds for services to initialize
2. Samples up to 5 ChatApplications
3. Samples up to 5 Chats
4. For each, checks: `redis_counter >= database_max`
5. If any inconsistency found: triggers recovery job
6. Logs results to Rails.logger

**Example logs:**
```
Redis counters are consistent with database
# OR
Inconsistency found for app 123: Redis=1000, DB=1050
Redis counter inconsistency detected! Triggering RebuildRedisCountersJob...
```

---

### 4. Health Check Endpoint
**Location:** `app/controllers/health_controller.rb`
**Route:** `GET /health/redis_counters`

**What it does:**
- Provides real-time Redis consistency monitoring
- Returns JSON with detailed status information
- Samples up to 10 ChatApplications and 10 Chats
- Returns HTTP 200 if healthy, 503 if inconsistent

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checked_at": "2025-10-29T19:00:00Z",
  "chat_applications": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Mobile App",
      "redis_counter": 100,
      "db_max": 100,
      "consistent": true
    }
  ],
  "chats": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "chat_application_id": 1,
      "redis_counter": 50,
      "db_max": 50,
      "consistent": true
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

**Inconsistent response:**
```json
{
  "status": "warning",
  "checked_at": "2025-10-29T19:00:00Z",
  "warnings": [
    "ChatApplication 1 (Mobile App): Redis counter (1000) < DB max (1050)"
  ]
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/health/redis_counters

# Monitor with watch
watch -n 10 'curl -s http://localhost:3000/health/redis_counters | jq .'

# Integration with monitoring tools
# Configure your monitoring system to:
# - Poll this endpoint every 1-5 minutes
# - Alert if status != "healthy"
# - Alert if HTTP status != 200
```

---

## Testing

### Run Recovery Job Tests
```bash
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rspec spec/jobs/rebuild_redis_counters_job_spec.rb
```

### Test Recovery Flow Manually

1. **Start the application:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Create some test data:**
```bash
# Create chat application
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat_applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat_application":{"name":"Test App"}}'

# Note the token, then create chats
TOKEN="your_token_here"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat_applications/$TOKEN/chats
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat_applications/$TOKEN/chats
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat_applications/$TOKEN/chats
```

3. **Simulate Redis crash:**
```bash
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

4. **Check health endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health/redis_counters | jq .
# Should show status: "warning" with inconsistencies
```

5. **Trigger recovery (or wait for automatic recovery on next restart):**
```bash
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails runner "RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_now"
```

6. **Verify recovery:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health/redis_counters | jq .
# Should show status: "healthy"
```

7. **Create new chat (should work and use correct number):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat_applications/$TOKEN/chats
# Should return number: 4 (not duplicate 1, 2, or 3)
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### For Existing Production Systems

1. **Update docker-compose.yml with AOF configuration:**
```bash
git pull
# Review changes to docker-compose.yml
```

2. **Restart Redis with new configuration:**
```bash
docker-compose stop redis
docker-compose up -d redis
```

3. **Verify AOF is enabled:**
```bash
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli CONFIG GET appendonly
# Should return: 1) "appendonly" 2) "yes"
```

4. **Run initial recovery job (to establish baseline):**
```bash
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails runner "RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_now"
```

5. **Restart Rails application (to load initializer):**
```bash
docker-compose restart web sidekiq
```

6. **Monitor logs for startup check:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f web | grep -i redis
# Should see: "Redis counters are consistent with database"
```

7. **Test health endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health/redis_counters
```

## Monitoring Setup

### Recommended Monitoring Alerts

1. **Health Check Monitoring:**
   - Poll `/health/redis_counters` every 1-5 minutes
   - Alert if `status != "healthy"`
   - Alert if HTTP status code != 200
   - Alert if response time > 5 seconds

2. **Log Monitoring:**
   - Alert on: "Redis counter inconsistency detected"
   - Alert on: "CreateChatJob failed" with "ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid"
   - Alert on: "CreateMessageJob failed" with "ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid"

3. **Redis Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Redis memory usage
   - Monitor AOF file size growth
   - Alert on Redis connection failures
   - Alert on Redis crashes/restarts

4. **Job Queue Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Sidekiq dead queue size
   - Alert on recurring job failures
   - Monitor `RebuildRedisCountersJob` execution time

### Example Monitoring Configuration (Prometheus/Grafana)

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'chat_system_health'
    metrics_path: '/health/redis_counters'
    scrape_interval: 60s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['chat-system:3000']

# Alert rule
groups:
  - name: redis_counters
    rules:
      - alert: RedisCountersInconsistent
        expr: health_redis_counters_status != 1
        for: 5m
        annotations:
          summary: "Redis counters are inconsistent with database"
```

## Performance Impact

### Redis AOF Persistence
- **Write latency:** +0.1-0.5ms per write (negligible)
- **Throughput:** -15-20% (still supports thousands of requests/second)
- **Disk usage:** ~10-50MB per million operations (compressed)
- **Memory usage:** No change

### Recovery Job
- **Execution time:** ~1-5 seconds per 1000 applications/chats
- **Database load:** Minimal (SELECT MAX queries only)
- **Redis load:** One SET per counter (fast)
- **Recommended frequency:** On-demand or startup only

### Health Check Endpoint
- **Response time:** <100ms (samples only)
- **Database load:** 20 queries (10 apps + 10 chats)
- **Redis load:** 20 GET operations
- **Recommended polling:** Every 1-5 minutes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Health check shows inconsistencies after fresh start
**Cause:** Database has records but Redis is empty
**Solution:** Normal behavior, initializer will auto-trigger recovery job
**Verify:** Check logs for "Triggering RebuildRedisCountersJob"

### Issue: Recovery job keeps running but doesn't fix counters
**Cause:** Database transactions or job retries interfering
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check job status
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails runner "puts Sidekiq::Queue.new.size"

# Manually flush and rebuild
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli FLUSHDB
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails runner "RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_now"
```

### Issue: New chats/messages still failing with duplicate numbers
**Cause:** Recovery job hasn't completed or counters need rebuild
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current counters
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli KEYS "chat_app:*"
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli GET "chat_app:1:chat_counter"

# Force rebuild
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails runner "RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_now"
```

### Issue: AOF file growing too large
**Cause:** Normal Redis operation
**Solution:** Redis automatically rewrites AOF when it gets too large
**Manual trigger:**
```bash
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF
```

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Daily:**
- Monitor health check endpoint
- Check for job failures in Sidekiq

**Weekly:**
- Review Redis AOF file size
- Check error logs for counter inconsistencies

**Monthly:**
- Test recovery process in staging
- Review and optimize health check sampling

**After Incidents:**
- Run recovery job if Redis crashed
- Check health endpoint after database restores
- Verify counter consistency after system maintenance

## FAQs

**Q: What happens if Redis crashes?**
A: AOF persistence ensures max 1 second of data loss. On restart, startup initializer detects inconsistencies and triggers automatic recovery.

**Q: Can I trigger recovery manually?**
A: Yes: `docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails runner "RebuildRedisCountersJob.perform_now"`

**Q: How do I know if counters are inconsistent?**
A: Check `/health/redis_counters` endpoint or watch Rails logs on startup.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**
A: Minimal. AOF adds ~0.1-0.5ms per write. Recovery job runs only when needed. Health checks are fast samples.

**Q: Should I run recovery job regularly?**
A: No, only run on-demand or let startup initializer trigger it. Regular runs are unnecessary with AOF enabled.

**Q: What if health check always shows warnings?**
A: This indicates persistent inconsistency. Check if recovery job is failing or if there's a bug in the sequential number generation.
